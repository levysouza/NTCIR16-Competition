This repository focuses on the task of Dataset Search. Given a query and a dataset collection, the goal is to retrieve a ranked list of datasets. In order to explore this task, we perform experimental evaluations by using document retrieval approaches, sentence encoders and language models such as BERT. For that, we use the public data of the NTCIR-16 competition: a shared task for ad-hoc dataset retrieval.
