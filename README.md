## Task Overview

This repository focuses on the task of Dataset Search for the NTCIR-16 Conference. Given a query and a dataset collection, the goal is to retrieve a ranked list of datasets. We perform experimental evaluations by using document retrieval approaches, sentence encoders and language models such as BERT. For that, we use the public data of the NTCIR-16 competition: a shared task for ad-hoc dataset retrieval. As follows, we present the main results in terms of NDCG and recall at several cutoffs for each search methodology.
